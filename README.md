# Portal rendering with planes and AABB

This is how axis aligned bounding boxes around portals are found using mathematical plane frustums.

Download the project as a zip file and add it to Unity hub then after it is opened click on the sample scene to load the project.

I recreated Bisqwit's 2D portal rendering tutorial map into 3D.
